Make sure you have Node.js installed, once that is installed you should be able to go the file on a terminal, and use the command
npm install. Once all of the necessary files are installed you should be able to access it at http://localhost:8080/.
The website is fairly straight forward, to display the punchline press the corresponding button, rate it, and then press the corresponding button to recieve a new joke. The new joke will be based upon your rating of the old one, giving it 1 star will give you a new random joke of a different type of which there are 3 types: programming, general, and knock-knock. If you were to rate a knock-knock joke 1 star, you would either randomly get a general joke or a programming joke instead. 2-4 stars means you get a random new joke of any kind. If you rate the joke with 5 stars, you will get another joke of the same type.
